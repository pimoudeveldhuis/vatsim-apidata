## VATSIM API Data

The VATSIM API Data tool crawls the VATSIM API for pilots, air traffic control and more. This information can be used for a virtual airline, statistics website for VATSIM and many more. It uses [Spatie\ShortSchedule](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-short-schedule) to keep up with the 15 second refresh rate on the VATSIM API, but of course you can move the function into the normal schedule and crawl it once a minute if you do not need the data to be accurate on a 15 seconds timeframe.
